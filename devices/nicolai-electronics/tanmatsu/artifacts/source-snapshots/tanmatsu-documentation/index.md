# Introduction

Tanmatsu is the dream terminal device for hackers, makers, and tech enthousiasts. Based around the powerful ESP32-P4 microcontroller, this device provides an accessible way to make, hack, and tinker on the go.

Tanmatsu lets you program on the go and communicate over long distances using LoRa whilst also providing advanced connectivity and extendability options for hardware hacking and development.

## Project

We have published an issue tracker on Github, where you can follow our project progress.

You can find out what we are currently working on in the [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/Nicolai-Electronics/projects/2/views/2).

If you have a suggestion or bug report you can create an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/tanmatsu-issue-tracker/issues).

And if you have questions or just want to ask something, feel free to ask anything you want over at our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/KkY6JqNCqT).

## Features

Tanmatsu is based around the upcoming ESP32-P4 SoC by Espressif: their most powerful RISC-V microcontroller yet. With its 360MHz dual-core processor and 32MB of built-in PSRAM it makes the ideal platform for powerful processing on the go whilst still maintaining the ease of use one expects form a microcontroller platform.

In addition to the powerhouse ESP32-P4 application processor we have included an ESP32-C6 WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and IEEE802.15.4 wireless radio module. This module enables wireless internet access, as well as access to local mesh networking like Thread and ZigBee in a hacker friendly way.

An Ebyte [E22-900M22S](https://www.cdebyte.com/products/E22-900M22S) LoRa radio module provides access to LoRa networks such as long distance mesh network services and (G)FSK modulated classic communication in the `850~930 MHz` band.

The device has 16MB of built-in flash storage for firmware, files and applications, expandable using a micro SD card. The micro SD card socket supports SD cards at 3.3v and 1.8v voltage levels for extra fast transfer speeds.

A big MIPI DSI display and the QWERTY keyboard make for great ease of use both in the workshop and on the go.

In addition to all the built-in functionality the device allows for expansion modules using its two expansion ports. The back facing expansion port allows for expanding functionality using personality modules, while the side facing expansion port (`CATT`) allows for easily connecting a wide variety of PMOD and SAO compatible accessories.

A QWIIC style expansion connector allows connecting the device to a wide range of sensors available from manufacturers such as Sparkfun and Adafruit, it is connected to the `I3C` peripheral of the ESP32-P4, allowing use of both the I2C and the new I3C communication bus standards.

A 3D printed case is included with every Tanmatsu, this sturdy case will allow the device to be used anywhere whilst keeping the electronics safe and protected (the device is not IP rated, not dust nor waterproof).

## Software

The launcher firmware allows starting user made applications and in addition it provides access to a repository for applications where developers can publish their creations. Apps can be downloaded and installed directly on the device.
