# ESP-IDF from scratch

ESP-IDF is can be a bit of a moving target at times, because of this we recommend not using one system wide installation but one per project. By doing this you can avoid compatibility problems between the ESP-IDF version and your projects.

This document describes how to start a new ESP-IDF project with ESP-IDF installed on a per-project basis.

## Requirements

 - A computer with a Linux distro or a Debian/Ubuntu WSL2 environment installed
 - Git should be installed (`sudo apt-get install git`)

## Create a project folder

Create a new folder in a place you can access, make sure there are no spaces in any part of the path.

## Download ESP-IDF

Find the [release of ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/) you want to use and inside of your new project folder execute the `git clone` command detailed in the release notes.

For ESP-IDF version 5.5.2 the `git clone` command is:

```
git clone -b v5.5.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v5.5
```

## Installing ESP-IDF

First you want to set two environment variables, `IDF_PATH` to set the path at which the ESP-IDF SDK is located and `IDF_TOOLS_PATH` to set the path to which ESP-IDF installs the toolchain files.

You can do this by creating a new text file, name it for example `env`. Open it with your text editor and store the following commands into the file:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export IDF_PATH="$PWD/esp-idf-v5.5"
export IDF_TOOLS_PATH="$IDF_PATH-tools"
```

After storing this file run `source env` to activate the environment variables in your current shell. You have to do this every time you open a new shell and want to start working on the project.

In the shell in which you have sourced the environment file run the install command from the ESP-IDF folder:

```
./esp-idf-v5.5/install.sh
```

This should automatically create the `esp-idf-v5.5-tools` folder in your project directory. The installation process will end with a message reading

```
All done! You can now run:

  . ./esp-idf-v5.5/export.sh
```

Ignore those instructions, instead you will need to extend the `env` file with the environment included with ESP-IDF. For that extend the `env` file as follows:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export IDF_PATH="$PWD/esp-idf-v5.5"
export IDF_TOOLS_PATH="$IDF_PATH-tools"
source "$IDF_PATH/export.sh"
```

Now source your environment again by running `source env` once more.

The command output should end with:

```
Done! You can now compile ESP-IDF projects.
Go to the project directory and run:

  idf.py build
```

This means ESP-IDF is now ready for use.

## Creating a project

Run `idf.py create-project hello_world` in which `hello_world` is the name of your new project.

## Switching to a different ESP32 variant

By default the ESP-IDF SDK targets the original `ESP32`. If you for example want to target the `ESP32-P4` you can do so by running:

```
idf.py set-target esp32p4
```

## Building your project

To build the project simply run:

```
idf.py build
```

## Flashing your project

To overwrite the firmware of an ESP32 board with your new project you can either run the `esptool.py` command presented by ESP-IDF in the build output or you can run:

```
idf.py flash --port /dev/ttyACM0
```

In which `/dev/ttyACM0` is the target serial port. On Windows this would be a `COM` port such as `COM5`, you can find out using the Windows `Device Manager`.


## Viewing debug output

ESP-IDF includes a monitor tool which automatically converts printed addresses into filename and line information.

You can start the monitor using:

```
idf.py monitor --port /dev/ttyACM0
```

You can also build, flash and start the monitor in one command:

```
idf.py build flash monitor --port /dev/ttyACM0
```

To exit out of the monitor press `CTRL+]`.

## Making your app print hello world

The entry point of your app is the `app_main()` function in `main/hello_world.c`.

Open that file and as `#include <stdio.h>` is already present you can simply add `printf("Hello world!\r\n");` to the main function to output `Hello world!` into the monitor.

Simply run the flash and monitor command (`idf.py build flash monitor --port /dev/ttyACM0`) again to rebuild and flash your app. The monitor should start automatically after your app is compiled and flashed successfully and it should print `Hello world!` (after some logging of the boot process).

## Installing the board support package for Badge.Team badges and Nicolai Electronics Tanmatsu

Exit out of the monitor (`CTRL+]`). Then add the `badge-bsp` component using the command:

```
idf.py add-dependency "badgeteam/badge-bsp^1.0.0"
```

Also take a look at [components.espressif.com](https://components.espressif.com/) for more fun libraries you can use in your projects.

After adding the `badge-bsp` component to your project you can use the BSP to initialize the peripherals of the board. To do that add the `#include "bsp/device.h"` header to your `hello_world.c` file and run `bsp_device_initialize(...);` in your `app_main()` function.

Your `hello_world.c` will look like this:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "bsp/device.h"

void app_main(void)
{
    const bsp_configuration_t bsp_configuration = {
        .display =
            {
                .requested_color_format = BSP_DISPLAY_COLOR_FORMAT_24_888RGB,
                .num_fbs                = 1,
            },
    };

    esp_err_t res = bsp_device_initialize(&bsp_configuration);
    if (res != ESP_OK) {
      printf("Failed to initialize BSP\r\n");
      return;
    }

    printf("Hello world!\r\n");
}

```

Note: the color format provided can differ from the requested color format depending on the target hardware, for Tanmatsu 888RGB and 565RGB are both valid options which will be honoured, but for other targets this does not have to be the case.

The `badge-bsp` component needs to be configured to target the Tanmatsu, by default it will target a stub target. You can select Tanmatsu as target using menuconfig:

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

Using the menuconfig screen go to `Component config -->`, `Badge.Team BSP -->`, `Board (...) -->` and select `Nicolai Electronics Tanmatsu` from the list.

In addition to the target selection there are other options that need to be configured. Currently the `badge-bsp` component requires that the `RTC retained memory` has a user section. This is not enabled by default.

To change this setting go back to the main menu of the menuconfig screen (`ESC`), then navigate to `Bootloader config --->` and select the `Reserve RTC FAST memory for custom purposes` option. Then set the `Size in bytes for custom purposes` option to `0x100`.

Third, for ESP32-P4 projects (Tanmatsu projects) enabling the `experimental` high speed PSRAM feature is a must. On Tanmatsu your app will not have enough memory for the framebuffer otherwise. If you were to run your app as-is it would crash with the following error:

```
E (230) lcd.dsi.dpi: esp_lcd_new_panel_dpi(226): no memory for frame buffer
E (230) st7701_mipi: esp_lcd_new_panel_st7701_mipi(103): create MIPI DPI panel failed
```

To enable PSRAM go back to the main menu of the menuconfig screen (`ESC`) and select the `Make experimental features visible` option. Then go to `Component config --->`, followed by `ESP PSRAM --->`. Select the `Support for external PSRAM` option and enter the new `PSRAM config --->` menu that appears. Enter the `Set PSRAM clock speed (20MHz clock speed)  --->` menu and select the `200MHz clock speed` option.

Press `q` to quit, then press `y` to save.

Now run `idf.py build flash monitor --port /dev/ttyACM0` again to build, flash and monitor the app.

You are now ready to start using the project you created to do awesome things!
