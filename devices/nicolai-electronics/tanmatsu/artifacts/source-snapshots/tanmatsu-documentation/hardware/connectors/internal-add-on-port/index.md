# Internal add-on port

```{toctree}
:hidden:
```

This port is not exposed by default, and a modified back cover needs to be used to make it accessible. For this reason the port is also named the "internal expansion port".

## Identification EEPROM

Please include a small EEPROM at address 0x50 on your boards, this will allow Tanmatsu to identify which add-on board has been connected.

The format for the content of this EEPROM has yet to be determined, currently the launcher firmware has no support for identifying add-ons.
The format will most likely be based on the format described [here](https://badge.team/docs/standards/sao/binary_descriptor/).

## Usage

We recommend to start with the GPIOs that do not have shared functions. The following GPIOs on the add-on header can be used without limitations:

```E0, E1, E7, E8, E9, E10, E11, E12 and E13```

If the built-in LDO number 4 of the ESP32-P4 is enabled (this powers up the SD card slot) then the following GPIOs will be available,
a level shifter is included on the main board so these GPIOs are always using 3.3v voltage level regardless of the SD card operating in 3.3 volt or 1.8 volt mode.

```E3, E4, E5 and E6```

The following pins can also be used if remapped to GPIO, there might be some activity on these pins during startup or while the launcher is running:

```EXT_USB_P, EXT_USB_N, P4_TX and P4_RX```

The following pins share functions with other peripherals on the main board. Use these with caution:

```E2, I2S_MCLK, I2S_LRCK, I2S_DATA, I2S_SCLK, I3C_SDA and I3C_SCL```

Using these pins for other purposes than their intended purpose will render either on-board audio, the QWIIC port or the camera port unusable when the add-on board is plugged in.

## Limitations & warnings

- Total for all 3.3v outputs **must not exceed 1A** of current. It is generally adviced to stay well below this figure.
