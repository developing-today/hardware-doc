 - CPU: 32-bit RISC-V dual core microprocessor, up to 400 MHz
 - RAM: 32 MB
 - Flash: 16 MB

The datasheet for this chip is not yet publicly available

### Management coprocessor

Chip: WCH CH32V203C8T6

 - CPU: 32-bit RISC-V single core microprocessor, up to 144 MHz
 - RAM: 20KB
 - Flash: 64 KB

More information can be found in the [Datasheet](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32V203DS0_PDF.html).

The management coprocessor is responsible for reading the keyboard matrix and power management. It presents itself as an I2C peripheral on the internal I2C bus of the Tanmatsu and provides the following services:

 - Keyboard events
 - PWM control for the display backlight
 - PWM control for the keyboard backlight
 - Real Time Clock (RTC) backed by watch crystal
 - Alarm wakeup
 - PMIC control
 - Power switching for USB-A port
 - Power and boot-mode control for the ESP32-C6 radio module
 - Power switching for audio amplifier
 - Headphone detection
 - Addressable LED control for the 6 built-in addressable LEDs

The firmware for this chip will be made available under terms of the MIT license after the product starts shipping to customers. Modifying the firmware is of course possible but is not recommended.

The firmware of the coprocessor can be updated from the ESP32-P4 application processor, for this Nicolai Electronics developed an [ESP-IDF component](https://components.espressif.com/components/nicolaielectronics/rvswd) capable of reprogramming CH32V20x and CH32V30x microcontrollers from the ESP32-P4 application processor.

### LoRa radio

Tanmatsu comes with either an E22-900M22S (for 868/915MHz band) or an E22-400M22S (for 433MHz band) LoRa module preinstalled. The module has an IPEX-1 antenna connector, which is connected to an IPEX-1 to SMA adapter coax cable on Tanmatsus with an external LoRa antenna and directly via a coax cable to a flexible PCB antenna on Tanmatsus with an internal LoRa antenna.

Currently only the E22-900M22S (868/915MHz band) with external antenna variant is available for pre-order.

### Audio

Everest Semiconductor ES8156 audio codec:
 - Hardware volume control via I2C interface
 - Stereo audio DAC

FM8002A mono speaker amplifier:
 - Can be switched on and off using the coprocessor
 - Connected to built-in 8 Ohm speaker

### Power management

#### PMIC

Texas Instruments BQ25895RTW PMIC for battery charging and monitoring as well as DC/DC boost converter for 5 volt rail (to power USB-A port, addressable LEDs and 5 volt pin on the personality module expansion header).

Provides soft power on/off functionality when the device is battery powered and allows seamless transition between battery and USB-C power source.

#### 3.3v rail DC/DC converter

Texas Instruments TPS63020DSJR DC/DC buck and boost converter providing a stable 3.3v rail even when the battery voltage drops below 3.3 volt.

#### Backlight drivers

Two AP3032KTR backlight driver chips, one for the display and one for the keyboard backlight LEDs.
Brightness controlled using PWM via the CH32V203 coprocessor.

#### Standby power rail

A small LDO provides 2.5v to the Vbatt rail of the CH32V203 coprocessor even when the device is off. This uses almost no power (theoretically the battery would last over 10 years on a single charge if the device is never turned on, ignoring LiPo battery self-discharge) and allows the Real Time Clock in the CH32V203 coprocessor to keep track of time even when the device is off. A special latch circuit circuit allows the CH32V203 to power on the Tanmatsu using its alarm pulse output by emulating a press of the power button.

### Addressable LEDs

Six SK6805-EC20 addressable LEDs controlled by the coprocessor.

### Sensors

 - Bosch BMI270 IMU combined accelerometer and gyroscope
 - Header for optional SCD40 or SCD41 CO2, temperature and humidity sensor (not populated, modules are available on AliExpress) or other I2C controlled sensor
