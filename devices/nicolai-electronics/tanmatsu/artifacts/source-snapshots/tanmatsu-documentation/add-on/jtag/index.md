# JTAG and QWIIC add-on board

This add-on board plugs into the CATT connector on the side of your Tanmatsu and provides a standard 10-pin JTAG interface for debugging the ESP32-P4 application processor as well as a QWIIC connector for connecting I2C devices and a LED for quick visual feedback.

## Connectors

This section describes how the pins of the connectors on the board are connected to each other.
